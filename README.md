# Project Description
The Gesture-Controlled Music Player is a multidisciplinary endeavor that brings together the fields of computer science, HCI, and audio technology. It reimagines traditional music player interfaces and transcends the boundaries of conventional control mechanisms by allowing users to interact with their music using intuitive hand gestures.

Key Features:

TUIO Marker Integration: We utilize TUIO markers to create an interactive and dynamic environment where users can seamlessly interact with the music player. These markers serve as touchpoints for gesture recognition and control.

Gesture Detection and Classification: The core of the project relies on the utilization of MediaPipe and dollarpy, state-of-the-art gesture recognition technologies. These tools enable the system to accurately detect and classify a wide range of hand gestures, allowing users to control various music player functions effortlessly.

User-Friendly GUI: The project includes the development of a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript The GUI is designed with a focus on ease of use and aesthetics, providing an engaging and enjoyable music exploration experience.

Seamless Sockets Integration: The music player is implemented using Python, while the GUI is developed in C#. To ensure smooth communication between these two components, sockets are used, facilitating data exchange and real-time control.

Project Objectives:

Empower users to control music playback, volume, and other functions using natural hand gestures.
Enhance the user experience by providing an intuitive and engaging interface for interacting with music.
Promote the adoption of gesture-based interaction in the field of HCI and beyond.
Explore the potential of gesture recognition and marker integration in applications beyond music control.
